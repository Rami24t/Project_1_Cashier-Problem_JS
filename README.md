# Cashier Problem Node JS Project

A node js project that is based on the solution to the cashier problem in calculating the minimum amount of change that he needs to give back to the customer.

In addition to solving the problem in js, the project includes input correcting and validation and error handling and making a colorful UI in the terminal. 
It also includes making an interactive program that takes input from the user, processes it and gives the appropriate output.
It includes logging and autosaving to a file and reading from the log at the user's command, and a command to clear the log history. 
The program also includes an outro.

## Project 1: Cashier Problem .JS:

### Problem:
 Create a program that helps a cashier give adequate change to customers.
 The program should return the amount of notes and coins for the customer's change.
 
 #### Examples:
 
- If the price is €3.75 and the paid amount is €50, then the client should receive €46.25 back in change and the expected output should be something like:

  - 2 x €20
  - 1 x €5
  - 1 x €1
  - 1 x €0.2
  - 1 x €0.05

- If: Price: €4.50, Paid amount: €20, Change: €15.50 => Output should be something like:

   - 1 x €10
   - 1 x €5
   - 1 x €0.5

###### Note: Include outputs for exceptions e.g. price: €4, paid amount: €3.
