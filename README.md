# Project_1_Cashier-Problem_JS

 Problem:
 Create a program that helps a cashier give adequate change to customers. The program should return the amount of notes and coins for the customer's change.
 Example: If the price is €3.75 and the paid amount is €50, then the client should receive €46.25 back in change.
     The expected output should be something like:
     - 2 x €20
     - 1 x €5
     - 1 x €1
     - 1 x €0.2
     - 1 x €0.05
 Example: Price: €4.50, Paid amount: €20, Change: €15.50
     Expected output:
     - 1 x €10
     - 1 x €5
     - 1 x €0.5
     Note: Include outputs for exceptions e.g. price: €4, paid amount: €3.
